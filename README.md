# task

A work in progress repository to hold a reminder CLI toolkit - version 0.2

# Overview:

task works like a simple objective-based task manager. At present, it is not very capable. Right now, it can create quoted strings and add them to a recall file, which you'd then add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc profile to include at terminal startup or when you call 'task -a' to spit them back out for you.

Long-term, I am aiming to create a more flexible system that will add automatic `at` or `alert-manager` and `wall echo` entries for a more robust reminder system. 

I also would like to incorporate it with ordered list handlers so I can designate priority lists + sublisting and repeat goal tasks.

There are many task projects, this one is less about productivity and more about skill-sharpening for me, but eventually I hope it will be of some use to others, so It's opensourced.

Thanks for checking it out - if you're looking for a more fully-fleshed project of mine, see 'notes' or 'exp-gen'.
