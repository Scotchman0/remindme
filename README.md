# task

A work in progress repository to hold a reminder CLI toolkit - version 0.2

# RECENT PATCH:
- removed '-a', tasks now print with 'task' command by default
- added '-d' to remove by line
- added '-c' clear now offers a yes/no confirmation before wiping all tasks
- added '-r' option for reminder block entry (WIP) to set a timer and add cli notifications

# NEXT UPDATE GOALS:
- add reminders with 'at' + system notification/alerts

# Overview:
A simple CLI task manager that lets you print strings to a file for CLI recall/management. Echos contents to `~/.*shrc` on new shell startup and can be called manually with 'task'
Work in progress
